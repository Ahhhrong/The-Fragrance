# The Fragrance
This website allows user to shop for items such as facial cleansers, shampoos and more.

 
## Design Process
Our Design Process is creating a website/store that allows users to shop and purchase the products they desire at the comfort of their homes and have them delivered swiftly. Our webiste also shows the current top selling products as well as items that we recommend as gifts.   

As a user, I want to know the current top selling products to see what the general public feels is good.

As a user, when shopping for gifts, having recommendations will be very useful so that I know what is a good product to gift others. 

As a user, I want loyalty points so that I can redeem to buy items at a cheaper price.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Feedback form:
    1. Go to the "Feedback" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

2. Checkout Form:
   1. Go to the "Cart" Page
   2. try to submit empty form and verify that an alert & error message about the required fields appears.
   3. try to go to "checkout" page without any Product  and verify an alert about Empty cart appears.
