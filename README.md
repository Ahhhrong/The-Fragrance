# The Fragrance
This website allows user to shop for items such as facial cleansers, shampoos and more.

 
## Design Process
Our Design Process is creating a website/store that allows users to shop and purchase the products they desire at the comfort of their homes and have them delivered swiftly. Our webiste also shows the current top selling products as well as items that we recommend as gifts.   

As a user, I want to know the current top selling products to see what the general public feels is good.

As a user, when shopping for gifts, having recommendations will be very useful so that I know what is a good product to gift others. 

As a user,

    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid 8 Digit Phone NUmber and verify that a relevant error message appears

2. Checkout Form:
